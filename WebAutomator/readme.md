The paths in the framework for different configurations are in the PathConfiguration file.

The TestData required for the Test Cases can be placed in the TestData package.

The TestSuites package has the Test Cases which will be triggered by the TestNG. 
All the dependencies for the project are configured in the pom.xml

This framework can take screenshots and publish them over the report.
